# simple-react-boilerplate

Small boilerplate to create react components.

The reason for this is, because most react boilerplates are using webpack. In my opinion this is overkill.
My components are not supposed to be that huge. There is not much I need. Why should I implement thousands of 
loaders? For what?

* I want to test the components.
* I want to style the components. 
* I want to implement the components.

This can be done with this boilerplate.
