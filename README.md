# simple-react-boilerplate

Small boilerplate to create react components.

The reason for this is, because most react boilerplates are using webpack. In my opinion this is overkill.

There is not much I need. Why should I implement plenty of loaders? For what?

* I want to test the components.
* I want to style the components. 
* I want to include the components.

I also prefer to write in one language and don't want to pollute my project with coffeescript, es6, typescript,
sass, less, etc. This leads to a boring slow code generation. It's as annoying for the programmer as a slow
application for the customer.
